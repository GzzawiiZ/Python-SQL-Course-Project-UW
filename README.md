The purpose of this project is to make a complex analysis of a "movies top 1000" data set. We have downloaded the data set from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows). Each participants' part is in their folder.

First we have established a google big query connection to have access to it using SQL. 

Then we have done some basic analysis together and divided the tasks between us. 

After doing assigned tasks we have made a repository on git hub for easy access. 

Last part was a meeting dedicated to discussing results and uploading codes into repository.

We have used techinques learned during the course and some additional ones, extending the basic knowledge. The tasks were spread evenly and we met whenerver anybody encoutered any problems to do troubleshooting together.
